Try click around on this website, creating and deleting posts, or editing existing ones. **However, please don't edit this one though!**\n\n1. Fork and clone [the client-side repository](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-client)\n\n1. Fork and clone [the server-side repository](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-server)\n\n1. Open up both projects in Atom. Consider each of the four CRUD actions and trace the code from button click to insertion into the `.json` file! For each action, write down the file and functions that are called throughout the entire process. Throughout, add notes describing what's happening and note what questions you have.\n\n---\n\n### Guiding Questions\n\nThe following questions may help you in understanding the code.\n\n#### Server\n\n* What is the `-i` flag doing on [this line](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-server/blob/master/package.json#L7) and why is it helpful?\n\n* How do [these lines](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-server/blob/master/models/post.js#L4-L13) in the model dynamically choose which `.json` file to use?\n\n* What term did we learn that describes [this function](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-server/blob/master/models/post.js#L15-L17) in the model?\n\n* What is `Object.assign()` and how is it being used on [this line](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-server/blob/master/models/post.js#L53) in the model?\n\n* What is the [fields array](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-server/blob/master/controllers/posts.js#L2) being used for in the controllers file?\n\n* What is the difference between the [prune and complete](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-server/blob/master/controllers/posts.js#L41-L60) functions in the controllers file?\n\n* The controller's helper functions are put [under a different key](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-server/blob/master/controllers/posts.js#L64) when they're being exported. What do you think about _namespacing_ the functions like this?\n\n* This [PUT route](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-server/blob/master/routes/posts.js#L8) has a number of arguments passed into it! How is this working? Where have we seen something like this before?\n\n* What's the difference between [the PUT and PATCH routes](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-server/blob/master/routes/posts.js#L8-L9) and what is the same?\n\n#### Client\n\n* There are [a lot of script tags](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-client/blob/master/index.html#L7-L19) in the `index.html` file! Why is it that only the last file has the `defer` attribute?\n\n* Describe the purpose of each function in the [util.js](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-client/blob/master/scripts/util.js) file. What is `window.location` and `window.location.hash`? How does the `.replace()` function work?\n\n* [These lines](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-client/blob/master/scripts/main.js#L1-L3) in the `main.js` file correctly set the `baseURL` depending on whether the client is running locally or deployed. How does it do that?\n\n* What is the purpose of the [templates](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-client/tree/master/scripts/templates) folder?\n\n* [You can write Markdown](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-client/blob/master/scripts/templates/post.js#L2) in the text boxes and it will correctly render!  What library is making this possible?\n\n* What is the purpose of the [requests](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-client/tree/master/scripts/requests) folder? What else would you imagine might go here?\n\n* When you go to this website, by default you are redirected to the first blog post. Describe how the [code inside of render/home.js](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-client/blob/master/scripts/render/home.js) makes that possible.\n\n* Where else is `homeView.init()` called?\n\n* How does the code in the [render/sidebar.js](https://github.com/bwreid/ajax-blog-client/blob/master/scripts/render/sidebar.js) make the sidebar navigation work?\n\n* This doesn't have to be how you setup your frontend! What other ways can you imagine splitting up your code? What do you like or dislike about how the project is structured?"}]
